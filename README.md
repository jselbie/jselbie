### Hi there 

Here's a list of some interesting projects I have hosted on Github:

[Stuntman STUN Server](https://github.com/jselbie/stunserver) - an implementation of the STUN protocol for WebRTC, P2P, VOIP, and NAT traversal scenarios. More details at http://www.stunprotocol.org . Code is hosted around the world by well known companies and services. (C++)

[WREK Online](https://github.com/jselbie/wrekonline) - WREK is "Music you don't hear on the readio". Broadcasting from Georgia Tech at 91.1 FM.  This is an Android app that enables you to listen to the the live radio stream, the HD subchannel, or any of the pre-recorded specialty shows from the past week. Install from the Play Store at the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.selbie.wrek) (Android, Java)

[Schedule Builder](https://github.com/jselbie/ScheduleBuilder) - is a Java program that my server runs nightly to scrape wrek.org for programming information and publish back to a website for [WREK Online](https://github.com/jselbie/wrekonline) to reference. (Java)

[Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/jselbie/SudokuSolver) - guaranteed to ruin Sukodu for you. (C++)

[Cyber Radio 1](https://github.com/jselbie/CyberRadio1) - Before there was [WREK Online](https://github.com/jselbie/wrekonline), there was Cyber Radio 1. I wrote this client and server code in 1995 so that we could listen to WREK from the computer labs at Georgia Tech and on the various Unix workstation labs and across the Internet. While I'm super embarrased about the quality of code, I'm proud of what it did at the time (C).

[React-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/jselbie/React-Tac-Toe) - My first React JS app. (React, Javascript, HTML). Play it [here](https://www.selbie.com/react-tac-toe)

[xkcdclock2](https://github.com/jselbie/xkcdclock2) - My foray back into Android programming while learning Kotlin at the same time.
